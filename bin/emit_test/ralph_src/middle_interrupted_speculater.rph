   Testing speculatives further.  If have a chain of speculated objects:

   a -> b -> c

   where a is the root speculative object, b derives from a's value, and c
   derives from b's value, then want to ensure that if a is not backed out, but
   b is then, b gets removed from chain.

   Way testing this is to start three events: first, second, and third.
   priority(first) > priority(second) > priority(third).

   first eventually invalidates second, which should invalidate third (third has
   speculated on second).
