Ralph
============

Ralph is a domain specific language for writing distributed,
transactional programs.  Ralph wraps data on and logic executed by
multiple hosts in a network.  It automatically prevents deadlock,
rolls data back when a transaction fails, and hides data serialization
and deserialization from the programmer.
